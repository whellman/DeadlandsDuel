# The tutorial used this for various and sundry things for map generation.
#
# It included:
#
# game_map.py, class GameMap and all the methods used to generate and populate the map,
#     plus a method to see if a coordinate was blocking movement.
#
# rectangle.py, which had class Rect, with __init__, center, and intersect
#
# tile.py, with class Tile, method __init__ storing whether it blocked movement, sight, or both
#
