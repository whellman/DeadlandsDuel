#### The as-yet inaccurately named
# Deadlands Duel
## A roguelike, sort of, in very early stages

###### I quite like the look of the 'card table' area, at least.

This mostly-personal project is an attempt to learn about [the Deadlands Classic TTRPG](https://www.peginc.com/store/deadlands-classic-20th-anniversary-edition/) and [the Python port of libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod) by smashing the two together, repeatedly and stubbornly.

The deeper I get into this project, the more I am convinced of the fundamental error of trying to make a beginner-dev roguelike out of a system like Deadlands Classic, where much of the appeal is the mechanical choices and multiple paths at every step of play, e.g. the use of zero, one, or several "fate chips" to radically alter the result of a dice roll, after the fact and piecemeal.

That being said, it's at least at the point where you can stroll around a simple collection of buildings, shooting utterly helpless and immobile bandits.  Doing so is a good lesson in how badly your performance is affected by your character's traits and negative modifiers for distance and motion.
