# The tutorial used this for 'components', an alternative to inheritance.
# We put 'components' of objects here, so they can be re-used in many objects.
# The tutorial included:
#
# ai.py, with class BasicMonster, which had method take_turn.
#
# fighter.py, with class Fighter, methods __init__, take_damage, heal, attack
#
# inventory.py, with class Inventory, methods __init__, add_item, use, remove_item, and drop_item
#
# item.py, with class Item, with method __init__
