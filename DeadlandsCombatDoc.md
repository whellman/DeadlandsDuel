In Deadlands, combat is made up of ~5 second rounds.

Each `round` is made up of a number of `segments` determined by the quickness
skill rolls of the combatants.

# General procedure:

## Step One: Pre-Round Set-Up
If you might be surprised, make a **cognition** roll; *TN 5* if danger is expected, *TN 11* if not.

If you make it, you are not surprised, and proceed normally.

If you don't make it, you are surprised and get no cards/actions this round.
You get actions next round, conditional on a *TN 5* **guts** roll at that time.

Cards will be drawn to order the actions. Two `action decks` are in use: The `Marshal` (*NPCs*), and the `Posse` (*PCs*).

Begin by rolling **quickness,** *TN 5.*

If you go bust, you get no cards this round. Otherwise, draw **one** card, **plus one for each** `success` and `raise`, *up to a normal maximum of 5.*

If the deck runs out, reshuffle the discards immediately.
If someone draws a Black Joker, reshuffle after the round is done.

## Step Two: Beginning Of Round

Count down card ranks starting from **Ace.** *(, King, Queen, Jack, 10, ... 3, 2)*

When your card comes up, you have an opportunity to act.

You can choose to play it, or to hold your action and put it `up your sleeve`

If you and someone else both have the same rank of card, **suits break the tie.**
Order of action according to suits is: **Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs**
